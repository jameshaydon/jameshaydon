### James Haydon ðŸ‘‹

I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Imiron](https://www.imiron.io/).

Before that I was a researcher in Prof. [Ichiro Hasuo](http://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/)'s [ERATO Metamathematics for Systems Design](https://group-mmm.org/eratommsd/) Project at the _National Institute of Informatics_ [NII](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) in Tokyo. 

I've also worked quite a lot in industry, mostly using [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), most notably at [Artificial](https://artificial.io/) and [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/).

Before that, I was a PhD student at University of Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. [Minhyong Kim](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/Minhyong.Kim/).

I like to think about how to make programming more abstract, and created the [Lawvere](https://github.com/jameshaydon/lawvere) programming language.
